      <p>The US is one of the biggest tourist destinations for good reasons. It's vast and diverse. It's regions are
         unique and everyone will be able to find a place that they love coming back to every year. In May 2019, my 
         wife and I spent 44 days and drove 12,000 miles around the US
      </p>
      <p>The whole country is beautiful and it's easy to find great stops everywhere from Ohio to Texas. However, these 
         10 places are our highlights. There's mountains and deserts. There's hectic crowded urban jungles and
         there's remote desolate mountains. All 10 are one of a kind.
